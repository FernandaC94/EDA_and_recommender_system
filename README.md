# **Project Overview**

## **EDA**
This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preprocessing on one of the Amazon datasets. The main steps involved in the analysis are:
- Handling missing values: Appropriate techniques are applied to handle missing data points.
- Removing duplicated values: Duplicate entries are identified and eliminated from the dataset.
- Data type conversion: Necessary transformations are performed to ensure the correct data types are assigned.
- Cleaning unwanted characters: Unwanted characters or noise in the data are removed or replaced.
- Outlier detection: Outliers in the dataset are identified and dealt with using suitable techniques.
- Feature engineering: Additional features are created from the existing data to enhance the analysis.
- Data analysis with visualization: Visual techniques are employed to gain insights and patterns from the data.

## **Recommender Systems**
Two types of recommender systems have been implemented as part of this project:

**Content-based Recommender System**:

This approach recommends items based on the similarity between their characteristics and user preferences.
It focuses on understanding how content-based recommender systems work.

**Collaborative Recommender System**:

This approach leverages the historical behavior and preferences of users to provide recommendations.
It aims to explore the fundamentals of collaborative filtering.
Please note that the primary goal of these recommender system implementations is to understand the working principles rather than building robust systems. The project serves as a foundation for future developments in building more advanced recommender systems.
